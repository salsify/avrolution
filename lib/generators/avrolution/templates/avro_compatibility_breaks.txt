#
# name: The full name of the schema, including namespace.
#
# fingerprint: The SHA256 resolution fingerprint for the schema in hex.
#
# with_compatibility: The compatibility level to check against, and the level
#   to use during deployment. Defaults to NONE.
#
# after_compatibility: Optional compatibility level to set after a new schema
#   version is deployed.
